Self Driving Car Preparation

> Sensors
We gather data from the car's sensors. Self-driving cars mainly use three types of sensors to observe the world:
 - Camera, which records video,
 - Lidar, which is a light-based sensor, and
 - Radar, which uses radio waves.
All of these sensors detect surrounding objects and scenery. Autonomous cars also have lots of internal sensors that measure things like the speed and direction of the car's movement, the orientation of its wheels, and even the internal temperature of the car.

> Reducing Uncertainty
 - Self-D-car measures 'direction','speed','location','scenary','surrounding objects', etc...with sensors. And this sensor measurement are not perfect, so when the information they provide is combined(using BayesRule), we can form a reliable representation - movement, position, environment.
 - Probability Distributions are a mathematical way to represent the uncertainty across all possible outcomes(the system).
   - It can be visualized using a graph especially in 2-dimensional cases.
   - It makes it much easier to understand and summarize the probability of a system whether that system be a coin flip experiment or the location of a self-driving car.
